# Used-car-price-prediction
The Car Price Prediction project leverages machine learning to estimate the price of a car based on various input features. It aims to provide users with a tool that predicts car prices using key factors that influence market value.
# Problem Statement
Imagine you are working as a data scientist in Car Dheko, your aim is to enhance the customer experience and streamline the pricing process by leveraging machine learning. You need to create an accurate and user-friendly streamlit tool that predicts the prices of used cars based on various features. This tool should be deployed as an interactive web application for both customers and sales representatives to use seamlessly.
# features
1. Inteactive UI using steamlit
2. Predicts the price of used cars approximately
3. Using powerful machine learning algorithms
4. Review and Selections are available
